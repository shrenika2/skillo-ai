AI-Driven Campus Hiring Platform

A unified on-campus hiring and internship platform that connects students, companies, faculty, and administrators through role-based dashboards, intelligent preparation tools, and data-driven hiring workflows.

📌 Overview

This project addresses the inefficiencies in traditional campus placements by providing a single intelligent ecosystem where:

Students prepare using company-specific questions and roadmaps

Companies manage campus drives using AI-assisted shortlisting

Faculty contribute internships and mentorship

Admins ensure fairness, transparency, and governance

The platform is designed primarily for on-campus hiring and internships, with scalability across multiple institutions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Students prepare blindly without knowing real company expectations

Recruiters spend excessive time manually filtering candidates

Colleges lack centralized visibility and fairness control

Skill gaps between student preparation and company requirements remain unaddressed

💡 Solution

An AI-driven, role-based campus hiring platform that integrates:

Preparation → Evaluation → Selection → Analytics
into a single, streamlined workflow.
